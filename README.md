# Helmet

This is a little game for Android **heavily** inspired by the Nintendo's Game&Watch handheld game "Helmet".

## Rules

Move the guy from the left building to the workshop on the right side of the screen and don't get hit by the falling tools! You get 1 point for every 3 successfully avoided tools (counts only after leaving the left building) and 5 points for reaching the workshop.  You can enter the workshop only when the door is open. Get hit 4 times and it's game over! The tools fall faster after 50, 200 and 500 points.

## Controls

Touch the left half of the screen to move the guy left (you cannot return to the left building) and the right half of the screen to move the guy right.

## Editing the project

The simplest way to edit the project is to download the repository as a zip file and open it in the Android Studio. The game has been created using the [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) library, but it already contains dependencies.
